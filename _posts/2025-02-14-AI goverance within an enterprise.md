# AI Governance within an enterprise.

AI is a powerful force and enterprises need to adopt a structured approach to integrating AI systems into their enterprise. AI regulation and governance is crucial to ensure compliance with regulations, build trust, mitigate risks, and facilitate ethical AI usage. Regular audits, transparency, and documentation of AI operations help with regulations.  ISO/IEC 42001 was crafted to tackle the concerns and obstacles associated with the conscientious deployment of AI technologies by providing a set of criteria for the establishment, maintenance and continuous enhancement of an AI management system. ISO/IEC 42001 was created in 2023, and stands out as a milestone with the introduction of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 42001 standard.

## ISO/IEC 42001 at a high level

Incorporating an AI management system within an organization’s pre-existing operational and management frameworks is crucial. The framework at a high level covers the following fundamental elements:

- Security: protecting AI systems from unauthorized access and threats
- Safety: safeguarding that AI operations do not pose risks to humans or property
- Fairness: promoting unbiased decision-making and preventing discrimination
- Transparency: providing clear insights into AI processes and decisions
- Data quality: overseeing the accuracy and integrity of data used by AI systems

## Overview of ISO 42001 framework

- AI management: Sections 4-10 of ISO 42001 delineate the AI management system, outlining the governance of the program.
- AI policy requirements: The standard specifies a range of policy requirements, including a comprehensive AI policy, guidelines for AI use in products, appropriate use and others.
- AI risk evaluation: It mandates conducting AI risk assessments and impact evaluations.
- 38 specific controls: ISO 42001 includes 38 distinct controls that organizations will need to comply with during assessment.

## ISO/IEC 42001 structure

The ISO/IEC 42001 standard is structured into 10 comprehensive clauses. These clauses cover various aspects of implementing and maintaining an AI management system (AIMS) within an organization.

- Clause 1: Defines the standard's intent, target audience, and the contexts of its application.
- Clause 2: Lists external documents that are integral to the standard's implementation, including ISO/IEC 22989:2022, which details AI-related concepts and terminology.
- Clause 3: Provides a glossary of crucial terms and definitions necessary for understanding and applying the standard's requirements.
- Clause 4: Requires organizations to recognize internal and external factors that can impact their AIMS, including roles related to AI systems and other pertinent operational factors.
- Clause 5: Mandates that top management demonstrate leadership, integrate AI requirements with business processes, and promote a culture that supports responsible AI usage.
- Clause 6: Directs organizations to plan for managing risks and opportunities, establish AI objectives, and create plans to achieve them, including planning for changes.
- Clause 7: Insists that organizations provide the necessary support regarding resources, skills, awareness, communication, and documentation to support the AIMS' establishment, execution, maintenance, and continuous improvement.
- Clause 8: Sets forth requirements for operational planning and control to fulfill AI-related requirements, manage identified risks and opportunities, conduct impact assessments for AI systems, and manage changes efficiently.
- Clause 9: Compels organizations to monitor, measure, analyze, and evaluate the AIMS' performance and efficacy. It also calls for internal audits and management reviews to confirm the AIMS' ongoing relevance, adequacy, and effectiveness.
- Clause 10: Emphasizes the need for continuous improvement of the AIMS by addressing any discrepancies through corrective actions, assessing their effectiveness, and keeping documented records to maintain accountability and monitor progress.


The ISO standards are valuable resources that can improve an organization’s understanding of AI and ensure their practices are in line with the latest international benchmarks. ISO/IEC 42001 implemented within an enterprise can help provide governance around your AI systems.
